# Current State

Last updated: 2026-04-08
Status: active
Current stage: F-015 semantic review adjacent context peek is completed
Active module: F-016 semantic review focus-span summary
Active frontier: F-016 Semantic Review Focus-Span Summary
Active question: how to summarize the current focused semantic review subset as a compact span-level cue so editors can understand the shape of the active review slice without opening a dashboard or planning layer

## Where the project is now

The repository is initialized and synchronized as a source-of-truth project system.

At this point:

- the repository is initialized as a Project Brain rather than as an unstructured empty code folder;
- the project is defined as a desktop-first Communication DNA content engine centered on film analysis to multi-format content production;
- interface-first product framing is completed through `USER_FLOWS.md`, `SCREEN_MAP.md`, `UX_PRINCIPLES.md`, `CONTENT_OUTPUT_SPEC.md`, and `PLATFORM_RULES.md`;
- MVP desktop interface specification is completed through `MVP_DESKTOP_INTERFACE.md`, `SCREEN_STATES.md`, and `NAVIGATION_BEHAVIOR.md`;
- domain model and module-boundary fixation are completed through `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `PROJECT_INTAKE.md`, `DNA_SEMANTIC_ENGINE.md`, and `SCENE_MATCHING.md`;
- data schema, project file format, and asset-pipeline boundaries are completed through `DATA_SCHEMA.md`, `PROJECT_FILE_FORMAT.md`, and `ASSET_PIPELINE.md`;
- render/export-facing schema and downstream output boundaries are completed through `RENDER_EXPORT_SCHEMA.md`, `LONG_VIDEO_BUILDER.md`, `SHORTS_REELS_BUILDER.md`, `CAROUSEL_BUILDER.md`, and `PACKAGING_ENGINE.md`;
- the first bounded MVP implementation slice is real through a local-first runtime that can create a project, accept analysis text, derive semantic blocks, persist them on disk, and inspect them in a desktop-facing semantic workspace;
- the semantic workspace now supports persisted selected-block editing, project-level review state, persisted ordering, approval-readiness visibility, one approval guardrail, explicit reopened-after-change visibility that survives reload, persisted semantic boundary editing through minimal split/merge controls, deterministic completeness / issue visibility across the project and selected-block inspector, and persisted output-suitability review controls for long video, shorts/reels, carousel, and packaging;
- the main MVP operating surface remains fixed as `Semantic Map Workspace`;
- the meaning-first architecture is now explicit across product, domain, schema, project-package, asset, downstream output, and implementation layers;
- the project now uses a manager-led execution model;
- ChatGPT owns strongest-next-step selection;
- Codex owns repository execution and state synchronization;
- manager review depth and next-step efficiency-gate doctrine are now fixed in repository governance documents rather than left to chat memory;
- F-015 is completed and no longer the active runtime frontier;
- the current active frontier is now `F-016 Semantic Review Focus-Span Summary`.

## Accepted boundaries right now

- The repository is run as a single system of documents.
- `00_INDEX.md` owns navigation only.
- Live project state is owned by this file.
- The active implementation packet is owned by `05_CODEX/NEXT_TASK.md`.
- The project starts desktop-first.
- MVP is centered on project creation, source intake, semantic blocks, semantic-map review, and the approved semantic-first desktop operating surface.
- manager-led execution model is fixed.
- ChatGPT must review Codex handoffs at completion level and management level before selecting the next packet.
- strongest-next-step selection must pass an efficiency gate rather than follow previous recommendations by inertia alone.
- architecture layers through downstream output-boundary fixation are completed before broad runtime expansion.
- the current runtime proof remains local-first, file-based, and intentionally narrow.
- The next implementation lane must not drift into automatic film downloading, full render automation, platform publishing, or speculative AI quality scoring.

## Open items

- add one minimal span-level summary for the current focused semantic review subset inside Semantic Map Workspace;
- keep the active focus slice readable as a compact range/count cue while preserving the existing selected-block and adjacent-context surfaces;
- improve review orientation without introducing a dashboard surface, planning panel, or broader navigation subsystem.

## Next step

Open and execute one bounded packet for `F-016 Semantic Review Focus-Span Summary`.

## What must not be lost in a new chat

- The project is not just a video editor; it is a meaning-to-media engine.
- The correct logic is `analysis text -> semantic blocks -> scene matching -> timecodes -> rough cut -> shorts/carousel/package`.
- manager-led execution model is fixed.
- MVP main surface is `Semantic Map Workspace`.
- product, domain, schema, project-file, asset, and downstream output-boundary layers are fixed.
- F-015 is completed with a compact adjacent-context cue that shows canonical previous/next semantic neighbors around the selected block and updates coherently after focus changes, navigation, reorder, and split behavior.
- ChatGPT must read Codex handoffs as management signals about capability gained, capability unlocked, unresolved gap, and packet-size efficiency before choosing what comes next.
- the next strong active runtime step is `F-016 Semantic Review Focus-Span Summary` unless a stronger efficiency-gated alternative is explicitly justified.
